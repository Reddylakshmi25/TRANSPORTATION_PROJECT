        <p className="p1-style">A traffic camera takes a picture when they detect an offending vehicle. The pictures capture details like the color, make, model, and license plate number of the vehicle along with the date and time of the offense, direction of travel, the speed of the vehicle, the lane a vehicle is traveling in, and other parameters.
        Such speed cameras either use radar technology to gather photographs and data of traffic violators or utilize the automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) system to monitor road rule compliance. These cameras may also be connected to an automated ticketing system. Also, some of these cameras are also utilized to capture texting-while-driving violators.
        ANPR systems have fixed or mobile speed cameras that time vehicles over a known set distance and then calculate the driverâ€™s average speed for that journey.
        Some of these cameras can also detect multiple vehicles in various lanes and are completely functional in all weather conditions. They are either battery-operated or have direct power supply facilities, and can be utilized either on their own or in conjunction with radar speed signs.</p>
